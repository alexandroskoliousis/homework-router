# usage: sys.sh [limit] [username] [service]
#
# Beyond the 'limit', a notification will be sent to
# 'username' via 'service'.
#
# To disable notifications all together, do not spe-
# cify any arguments. Then the results are only log-
# ged to a file.
#
# Or, to send an e-mail to user 'administrator' when
# 80% of memory or disk is used, run as
#
# sys.sh 80 administrator mail
